## Feature ideas and bug reports

If you notice something's not working quite as it should or that a feature you need is missing, please don't hesitate to contact me. Email me at mikko@mikkosaari.fi. I'm msaari on Twitter and BoardGameGeek, if you prefer.

[18SH thread at BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2225619/18sh-command-line-replacement-spreadsheets) is a good place to ask questions if you're a BGG user.

## Issues and pull requests

Feel free to post issues and do pull requests. If pull requests come with tests (18SH uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) + [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for testing), that's even better.
